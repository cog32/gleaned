2025-10-20 Stage 1 notes:
- Current git branch: 1-remove-url-box-main-page
- Likely related GitHub issue: #1 ([PAID] Remove the URL box from the main page)
- Mismatch: .current_work.ai mentions issue 2, but repository shows only issue #1 (closed).

2025-10-20 Stage 2 notes:
- Queried GitHub issues for repo cog32/gleaned-covid using gh.
- No open issues found. Issue #1 is CLOSED; no issue #2 exists.

2025-10-20 Stage 6 (Change Review):
- Ran root unit tests via vitest (non-watch): all 56 tests passed.
- Ran root BDD in dry-run to avoid hang: many undefined steps (expected; placeholders), no execution.
- Ran .covid/core Python tests in venv: multiple failures unrelated to this feature (Stripe webhook + placeholder module import). Not modifying core for this front-end issue.
- Ran markdownlint and remark link validation: warnings mainly in submodule docs/node_modules; no critical issues in root docs.
- Code review: main page no longer renders URL input; component file and styles remain but unused; keeping scope minimal per process.

Next: push branch and open PR referencing cog32/covid-gleaned#2; update public issue with status after PR creation.

2025-10-20 Stage 6 outcome:
- Branch pushed: 1-remove-url-box-main-page
- PR opened: https://github.com/cog32/gleaned-covid/pull/5
- Ready for Stage 7 (Deploy Prototype) if approved.

2025-10-20 Stage 7 (Deploy Prototype):
- Deployed via: python3 .covid/core/scripts/deploy_cloudflare_pages.py --deploy-local --project-name gleaned-covid
- Deployed URL: https://0e13c3a4.gleaned-covid.pages.dev
- Updated original issue (cog32/covid-gleaned#2) with URL and @cog32 mention.

2025-10-20 Cleanup:
- Removed unused URL input component and related CSS.
- Files changed: deleted src/components/url-input.ts; pruned URL-input styles in src/styles/main.css.
- All unit tests still pass (56/56).
