"""
Copybara configuration for bidirectional sync between public gleaned and private gleaned-covid repositories.

Rules:
- Public→Private: Sync all files from public repo
- Private→Public: Only sync files that already exist in public repo
- Features directory: Only synced to public if it already exists there (prevents pushing BDD to non-BDD projects)
- Never sync .covid directory (private only)
- Never sync setup/config files from private to public
